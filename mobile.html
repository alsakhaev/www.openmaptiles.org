    <p>The app can be rebranded and customized to present map layers with new look and
      feel, powered by the data hosted on your server or distributed together
      with your app!</p>
    <p>Presented are online & offline OpenStreetMap vector tiles created by
      OpenMapTiles team, designed in MapBox
      Studio Classic and stored in MBTiles.</p>
    <p>The raster tiles are generated from open data (GeoTIFF geodata) by
      <a href="http://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a>.</p>

    <p>Visualization is made with the open-source MapBox GL library, used
      without MapBox hosting plan. Look&feel of the map is derived from the
      BSD licensed OSM Bright style made by Development Seed / MapBox, and can
      be adjusted to display features, information, and colors according to the
      intended use case.</p>

    <p>The complete source code of this mobile application (as well as source
      code of other MapTiler mobile apps) is available to the regular MapTiler
      Pro customers. Rebranding, customization, consulting and contracted
      development of mobile applications, including geodata processing and
      vector tiles in custom coordinate systems is available on request. </p>
